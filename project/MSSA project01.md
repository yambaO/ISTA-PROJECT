"Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow." Anthony J. D'Angelo
I would like to describe myself as a person who is determined to overcome any kind of challenges rather than quitting. I am an entry level electrical/electronics engineer and an aspiring software developer, with diverse experience in the US Army who  worked as a repairer of multiple equipment system. I am currently exploring a new career in the IT industry through the MSSA program and hoping that by the end of the cohort, I should be able to acquire enough knowledges to turn my ideas into a beneficial project for all us in this world. 

#### E-book store

The E-book store project will content a wide range of books managed by a database. In order to use the application , the user  will be required  to open new member account. Once the user receive a confirmation that he/she has registered , he/ she will be able to login and take full advantages of the store services. The registered user will should be able to mark a book as favorite , read it or download on his electronic device. The idea behind a E-book store is to save time , and spaces in libraries. This is also a way to save our mother nature by avoiding cutting trees . 

#### Tracking system using mobile GPS 
This system is built in an application with a database where  GPS devices are registered by serial number. The device will be installed on a vehicle or a package moving from one location to the other. The user will use an electronic devices such as a smart phone or a computer's monitor to access the application.  The system will require the administrator to enter an admin ID and an associated  password to be able to access the tracker system. Once all the requirements are gathered, the administrator will be able to track  in real time, the location of any GPS devices registered in the database system. The application also allow the user to monitor the distance travelled or to find out the previous stops within 24hours.

#### Attendance system

This system can be used in schools / universities faculty to keep track on the students attendance so that the time and effort can be saved. Built- in an application, the system allows to create a student attendance sheet including his name , a ID number assigned to him. Now that the system has registered the user , the admin is able to generate a call roll sheet with the student name with Absent/Present mark. Via an internet channel the attendance data can be stored and maintained by the school or college.

#### My cuisine

This  application will require a new user to register in order to access the application's features. Once he/she is registered in  the system , he/she can sign on . The application is a recipe app which has  a particular functionality .The user has the possibility to choose a recipe based on the type of cuisine that he/she desire. The user can also pick a list of ingredients and the application will suggest a list of recipes. In addition to it, the application has a search bar , allowing the user to filter his research and target a specific recipe.


I truly believe that by putting  a lot of personal effort in Microsoft Software and System Academy program I should be able to acquire the needed skills  to design , build and deploy applications to the web by using  cloud bases services.
