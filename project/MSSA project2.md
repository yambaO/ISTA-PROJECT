#### Project 
Nowadays, technology is rapidly growing. We are experiencing a situation where technology tends to take over our lives. Even small electronics device such as a  smartphone makes our life so much easier than before because it does almost everything. You can have an application on your mobile device to purchase, read, find your location watch tv and so on. I am an aspiring software developer and I am passionate in cooking. I have  realized over the years that cookbook versus electronics cookbooks are more expensive ,  they have the  newest recipes that we wish to try and finally they take a lot of space on our book shelves. My future project will of a  simple recipe application("My cuisine") and I think that it  will be beneficial for all us in term of saving time , money , space .
My Cuisine will similar to the popular application "all recipes" . It will be available to download in an app store and will require the user to open an account in order to have access to the app. My cuisine app will have a variety of recipes grouped by  different type of cuisines. The user will also have the opportunity to choose the ingredients from a list and then match them with some of the recipes. I am also planning on incorporating a function to save favorites recipes and also to allow the user to add a new recipe in the database system.

#### Data
The  application  will be based on a database with at least five table . They are listed below:

​        1.Table of levels. This table will indicate the level in cooking the meal from difficult to easy.

​        2.Table cuisine shows the different type of cuisine. For example African , American ,     Italian.

​        3.Table recipes. In this table there will the title of a recipe , the prep time , the cook time , description  and the steps.

​        4.Table of measurements contains all the unit of quantities  possible needed to cook a meal.

​        5.Table of ingredients. Here are the list of ingredients necessary to cook a meal.

####  Interface

The project will be an phone application .The user will be able to download it from an app store .Access  to the application will require the user to open a member account. After registration the user will be able to enjoy the features provided by the app. On the home page of the app there will be a searching bar allowing the user to look for a specific recipe or an ingredient matching a recipes or more a type of cuisine.



Building this project requires knowledge in how to create a database , how to create table , how to input data sets values into table then some skill in programming language such C#. Once I acquire this skills , I  will learn how to build a web application using ASP.NET MVC Framework .
